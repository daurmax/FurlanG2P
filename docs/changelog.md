# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The project
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) conventions
adapted for a lightweight semantic versioning scheme.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-17

### Added
- Fully functional `normalize`, `g2p` and `phonemize-csv` CLI subcommands with
  file input/output options, JSON/plain emission modes and clear validation
  errors.
- `scripts/generate_phonemes.py` helper for batch phonemisation of
  LJSpeech-style metadata CSV files.
- Dataclass-backed `NormalizerConfig` and `TokenizerConfig` definitions plus
  JSON/YAML loader utilities so the normaliser and tokenizer can be tuned via
  external configuration.
- Cardinal number expansion up to `999 999 999 999` within the normaliser.
- Additional architecture and usage documentation in `docs/` alongside runnable
  examples in `examples/`, such as `pipeline_example.py`.
- Expanded seed lexicon entries (for example `gjat`, `z√ªc`) sourced from the
  cited references.
- Focused tests for the new CLI commands, rule contexts (including dialectal
  `z`) and normaliser behaviour, plus property-based checks that keep rule
  outputs inside the phoneme inventory.

### Changed
- Promoted `PhonemeRules` to the default rule engine and taught the
  `G2PPhonemizer` to fall back to it whenever the lexicon lacks a word.
- Enhanced phoneme segmentation to recognise additional digraphs like `dz` and
  `ts`.
- Replaced the experimental normaliser with the full implementation that expands
  numbers, abbreviations, acronyms and units, removing the temporary module.
- Updated the README guides to cover the implemented subcommands,
  configuration APIs and refreshed project layout.
- Adjusted the release workflow to accept `workflow_dispatch` triggers with a
  selectable release type, enforce the `main` branch, tag releases explicitly
  and publish with the PyPI API token.
- Refined `pyproject.toml` metadata and added optional YAML support via the
  `pyyaml` dependency.
- Bumped the published version to `0.1.0`.

## [0.0.5] - 2025-09-10

### Changed
- Replaced the MIT license with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial
  4.0 International license and shipped the full text in `LICENSE`.
- Updated packaging metadata and trove classifiers so distributions advertise
  the new license correctly.
- Documented the licensing change in both README variants and bumped the
  published version to `0.0.5`.

## [0.0.4] - 2025-09-17

### Added
- PyPI-focused `README-pypi.md` and packaging metadata that points to it so the
  distribution long description on PyPI renders the end-user guide correctly.

### Changed
- Rewrote the GitHub-facing `README.md` to highlight repository layout,
  contributor workflows and automation details for the release pipeline.
- Updated contributor guidance in `AGENTS.md` to reflect the newly implemented
  components and clarify documentation responsibilities.
- Bumped the published version to `0.0.4` to match the refreshed packaging
  assets.

## [0.0.3] - 2025-09-09

### Changed
- No code or documentation changes; retagged `0.0.2` as `0.0.3` to validate the
  automated release workflow.

## [0.0.2] - 2025-09-08

### Added
- Experimental `furlang2p ipa` CLI subcommand with options for rule-only
  conversion, slash-wrapped tokens and custom separators.
- Packaged gold lexicon, IPA canonicalisation helpers and a rule-based engine
  that back the CLI and service layer.
- Initial `docs/rationale.md` and `docs/references.md` notes describing the rule
  ordering and bibliography consulted for linguistic choices.
- Continuous integration and automated release workflows executed via GitHub
  Actions.
- Seed Hypothesis-powered property tests and Click-based CLI tests covering the
  new behaviour.

### Changed
- Normaliser, tokenizer, grapheme-to-phoneme converter, syllabifier, stress
  assigner, pipeline service and IO utilities now provide working
  implementations instead of raising ``NotImplementedError``.
- The phonemiser loads pronunciations from the packaged lexicon and falls back
  to deterministic letter-to-sound rules.
- Project metadata is now sourced dynamically from ``src/furlan_g2p/__about__.py``
  and includes updated author, repository URLs and development dependencies.
- `.gitignore` allows committed VS Code tasks and ignores Hypothesis caches.
- README content was expanded with quickstart instructions, CLI examples and
  contributor guidance aligned with the implemented features.

## [0.0.1] - 2025-08-23

### Added
- Initial public release with project scaffolding, stubbed modules, packaging
  configuration and placeholder tests.
